Applied Data Science & Python Engineering 🧪
This repository contains applied machine learning projects and advanced Python implementations. It demonstrates the ability to build end-to-end predictive models, engineer secure data pipelines, and optimize code performance.

🚀 Key Projects
1. Customer Churn Prediction (/churn-prediction)
Workflow: End-to-end pipeline including synthetic data generation, feature scaling, and class imbalance handling.

Modeling: Compared Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Tuned XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.84, optimizing for Recall to capture as many churners as possible.

2. Financial Data Engineering (/data-engineering)
Secure Pipeline: Implemented a data audit framework for financial claims.

Features:

Pseudonymization: Hashing user IDs with stable salts for privacy.

Temporal Splitting:Strict time-based train/test splits (2023-24 vs 2025) to prevent data leakage.

Audit: Automated checks for missing documents and status validity.

3. Advanced Python & Statistics (/python-concepts)
Feature Selection: Implemented Backward Elimination to statistically select model features based on P-values, reducing model complexity.

Memory Optimization: Demonstrated Python Generators for lazy evaluation, enabling processing of large datasets without memory overflows.

Text Processing: Advanced Regex patterns for extracting email addresses and structured data from unstructured text.
